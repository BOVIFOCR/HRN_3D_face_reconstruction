We present a novel hierarchical representation network (HRN) to achieve accurate and detailed face reconstruction from a single image. Specifically, we implement the geometry disentanglement and introduce the hierarchical representation to fulfill detailed face modeling.


## News

* [03/01/2023] HRN achieved top-1 results on single image face reconstruction benchmark [REALY](https://realy3dface.com/)!
